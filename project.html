			<li>Lyber.co - a fare and waiting time estimator for compairing both Uber and Lyft products. There are currently two client side applications, one on ios platform (available on AppStore: Lyber.co), the other as a web app (developed by Terrence Liu): <a href="https://lyber.co", target="_blank">htttps://lyber.co</a>. We also developed a backend server written in node.js and running on AWS which is handling the api calls and collecting data from these two client side applications. We hope to analyze and build new products with these data. Right now we're working on providing future fare predictions based on the price history data we got. <br>

				iBeacon Location Based App - an ios app I built for <a href="http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/default.page", target="_blank">Halliburton</a> as a side project. This app works as a data collection sensor. Specifically, it is installed on ios devices that are attached to equipments in the Halliburton working field. The purpose is to detect and report the entrance and exits of employees wearing beacons for each specific equipment and provide customized training/safety guidelines. This app is wired up with Halliburton's backend server using Experience API (xAPI) for doing further data analysis.<br>

				Trumpified Chat Bot - a speech generator built using higher order bidirectional markov chain and a huge dataset with Trump's speech. The model is well tuned such that when given a word, is going to generate a sentence containing this word that sounds like something Trump has said. This project is deployed on Heroku and available as an API.<br>
